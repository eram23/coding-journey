        <p>After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path, I've made the big jump over to the 
            Bootcamp to get expert code reviews of my Solo Projects projects and meet like-minded peers.

        <p class="subheader">How my journey began</p>
        <p>I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to create simple projects
            using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.</p>
        <p>While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning 
            and most things about my journey with the world.</p>
